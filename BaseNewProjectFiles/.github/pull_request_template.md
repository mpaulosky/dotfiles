## Self-Review Checklist

<!-- Complete before requesting review — incomplete PRs will be returned -->

### Code Quality
- [ ] I ran `dotnet build IssueTrackerApp.slnx --configuration Release` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- [ ] I ran `dotnet test IssueTrackerApp.slnx --configuration Release --no-build` — all pass
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME left unless tracked in a follow-up issue (link it)
- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or credentials committed

### Architecture
- [ ] New handlers follow the `Command`/`Query`/`Handler`/`Validator` naming conventions
- [ ] New handlers are `sealed`
- [ ] Domain layer has no references to `Web` or `Persistence.*` projects
- [ ] `Result<T>` / `ResultErrorCode` used for expected failures (no exception-driven control flow)
- [ ] DTOs are records in `Domain.DTOs`; Models are in `Domain.Models`
- [ ] No DTO types embedded in Model classes

### Tests
- [ ] New code has corresponding unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests use domain-specific collections (`[Collection("XxxIntegration")]`)
- [ ] No test compares two `IssueDto.Empty` / `CommentDto.Empty` instances directly

### Security (check if security-relevant)
- [ ] New endpoints have appropriate `RequireAuthorization` / policy applied
- [ ] No `MarkupString` used with user-supplied content
- [ ] No user input reflected in MongoDB queries without sanitization

### Merge Readiness
- [ ] Branch is up to date with `main` (no merge conflicts)
- [ ] CI checks are green (do not request review while checks are pending/failing)
- [ ] PR description is complete — reviewers should not have to ask what this does
