# ci.yml is Owned by the repo-ci-baseline Template and is overwritten on every
# Apply; this file is Seed, so it belongs to the repo. Put what only this repo
# needs here: tools the build runs (for example `corepack enable` for pnpm),
# images to pull or projects to publish before a test project runs. To pass
# environment variables to the later steps, append NAME=value lines to
# "$GITHUB_ENV".
#
# The test name comes from a file name in the PR, so treat it as data: quote
# it and never eval it.
